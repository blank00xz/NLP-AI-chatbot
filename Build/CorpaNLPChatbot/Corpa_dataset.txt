BACKGROUND The company requires the acquisiton of materials and the contractng of services in a tmely manner and in the best conditons of quality, opportunity and cost that the market offers for the development of the contracted projects. To support this, a Procurement Policy has been developed to keep the process simple and expeditous; and to ensure that effectvely through the Contnuous Improvement philosophy we contribute to cost reducton initat- ves, grantng transparency to each of the processes, in a safe, sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. This management of the Supply Area is based on the definiton of Corpa Engineering policies. PURPOSE • Generate appropriate controls of the procurement process. • Provide adequate tools for cost control. • Provide consistency in all purchasing and contractng operatons. PROCEDURE Any commercial transacton with suppliers must be carried out exclusively by members of the Supply Area and no other employee of Corpa Ingeniería is authorized to provide informaton to suppliers or to initate a bidding process that could affect or involve the company and as a consequence hinder any future commercial transacton. . The Supply Area will be in charge of managing the tenders on behalf of Corpa Engineering, making calls for tenders, conductng negotatons and ensuring that Corpa maximizes the value of money on each purchase. This will be carried out guaranteeing the provision of services on tme, coordina- tng the necessary approvals and ensuring faithful compliance with the internal policies, rules and procedures, as well as the laws in force in the Argentne Republic. PROCUREMENT FUNCTION The Supply Area will have the personnel, systems and services necessary to ensure the efficient executon of purchasing actvites, which include: • Maintain simple procedures that respond to the customer's purchasing needs. • Keep an updated supplier registry open. • Maintain updated electronic files and adequate documentaton www.Corpaing.net involved in all Purchase actvites. • Analyze and evaluate the quotes received, based on the combinaton of factors such as price, quality, delivery tme, etc. • Select suppliers with proven capabili- tes and ensure that they maintain satsfactory performance in Sustainable Development. • Minimize direct awards (single supplier). • Prepare Leters of Recommendaton, Commercial and Technical Analysis Reports of the offers received. • Clarify any doubts that suppliers may have. • Ensure that providers carry out the delivery of services in a tmely manner. • Maintain strict confidentality in all purchasing actvites. • Deepen knowledge of the markets for goods and services, developing market intelligence to detect opportunites and risks. PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR The Corpa Procurement team will develop labor relatons with other specialized Corpa areas such as Engineering, Legal Affairs, Finance, Accounts Payable, etc .; making use of your support for the purposes of review, comment and informaton during the process of developing the tenders and awards. In carrying out purchasing functons and responsibilites, it is expected that Area staff will conduct themselves in a highly professional and efficient manner; complying with the following characteristcs: • Careful knowledge of Corpa policies and practces. • Detailed knowledge and understanding of the Market. • Innovatve attude. • Precise strategic planning. • Flexibility in the selecton of the purchase method that best meets the needs of users and market conditons. • Use agile and simple contractng processes, understanding that these characteristcs depend on the magnitude and complexity of the good to be supplied or the service to be contracted. • Require a high level of compliance by Suppliers. • Possess knowledge of legal issues, incoterms and exposure risk in commercial situatons related to purchases. PROCUREMENT POLICIES GENERAL POLICY Corpa Engineering has as its policy the purchase of services, materials and equipment with duly approved technical characteristcs, from www.Corpaing.net suppliers that offer the cheapest cost, taking into account the technical specificatons, quality, price, delivery tme, service and operatng costs. All purchases must be made from commercially and financially suitable suppliers capable of satsfying the requirements. The company should try to obtain the best possible prices and all the additonal benefits that could result from long-term relatonships and partnerships with suppliers. SPECIFIC PRACTICES •All business relatonships with suppliers must be honest and efficient, treatng them fairly, regardless of the purchasing strategy selected. The supplier should not be allowed to create a false expectaton about a partcular business with Corpa Engineering. If more than one vendor is partcipatng in any stage of the Sourcing process, they should all receive exactly the same informaton, be offered the same terms, and given the same tme to respond or prepare a proposal. Informaton provided by a provider should not be published to other providers, either before or ater the award is made. • Purchasing Officers must ensure that suppliers understand what is expected of them and that the specificatons of the required equipment / services are clear. The use of specificatons, in a compettve process, developed by a partcular supplier must be used in such a way that they do not limit or exclude other compet- tors; in these cases the other providers should be encouraged to present other technical alternatves. • Once the award has been granted, the supplier must comply with all the requested specificatons and with the terms and conditons specified in the order. In additon to being a good practce, it is a sign of courtesy to reliably notfy the suppliers that partcipated in the compettve process that the order has already been granted. RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL ENTITIES Corpa Ingeniería expects that during transactons, its employees have an impartal treatment with suppliers to maintain a good image towards their clients. Any employee who directs or partcipates in purchasing actvites or who may have a positon from which a www.Corpaing.net decision may be influenced must be aware of the Corpa policy requirements as well as the Code of Ethics. The purchasing power of Corpa Ingeniería granted must not be used to obtain goods and services for the personal use of employees. Purchase requirements channeled through the Procurement Team should not be communicated or discussed with suppliers by members of other departments, except in those cases where technical assistance is required. Compliance with these principles will help eliminate misinterpretatons and leave more room for negotatons. In order to ensure that Corpa Ingeniería obtains advantages of respect and good reputaton, the following pract- ces must be followed in relatons with suppliers and Contractors: COMMUNICATIONS • Conduct with strict veracity in all communicatons and transactons. • Respond to leters and other inquiries in a tmely manner. • Provide accurate informaton. MEETINGS • Encourage productve meetngs, and politely avoid non-productve ones as well as frequent visits by suppliers. • Receive supplier representatves on tme. If this is not possible, explain why they cannot be received, and make an appointment to see them in the future. • Provide each supplier representatve with a complete, short and fair hearing for each issue that justfies it, depending on the nature of the request. • Stay free of commitments that could intervene with free and fair competton. • Document the important meetngs through signed minutes, or electronic proof of conformity of what was expressed in it as a result of the meetng. VISITS TO SUPPLIERS When appropriate, visit providers to stay informed on: • Facilites • Organizaton • Capacity • Methods • New materials or services that may be manufacturing or selling • Expansion or reducton plans • Key personnel • SD conditons (HSEC) CONFIDENTIALITY Respect the confidentality of supplier www.Corpaing.net informaton related to: • Quotes • Contractual arrangements • Other confidental informaton • Never post confidental Corpa proprietary informaton, and restrict internal distributon to only those who need it. MISTAKES You should not take advantage of errors incurred by the supplier or make commitments that could imply a burden that does not correspond to them. COMPLAINTS Provide fair and tmely atenton to complaints or claims. Demonstrate interest in the supplier's difficultes and, when possible, cooperate with it, without this implying harm to Corpa. Avoid complaints for trivial reasons. CLAIMS Make claims to suppliers whenever necessary. GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT • The CorpaEngineering Procurement Team may partcipate in certain types of recreatonal and / or leisure actvites that are combined with business meetngs in which the circumstances are considered appropriate and of interest to the relatonship between Buyer and Seller. These types of actvi- tes include working lunches or dinners, or sporadic industry meetngs. In case of doubts in this regard, the Supply Manager of Corpa Engineering should be consulted, before acceptng the invitaton. • It is not permissible, under any circumstance, to accept invitatons from suppliers that imply payments for travel or hotel stays. When Corpa Engineering considers it necessary for any of its employees to travel for business reasons, it will directly bear the expenses that this decision represents. CONFIDENTIALITY During the bid analysis process, the informaton provided by the potental supplier is reviewed. This informaton is generally confidental and sensitve to the provider. Similarly, there is a probability that your informaton will leak. Therefore, it is very important to raise awareness and maintain careful aten- ton regarding the requirements to adequately handle informaton during evaluatons. The distributon of the suppliers' proposals is restricted. When requested under a sealed envelope, the company procedure must be followed. Proposals www.Corpaing.net must remain in a secure and locked place while not in use. The distributon of proposals should be limited so that partcipants in the process only receive the secton related to their work. Each individual is responsible for the sectons in their possession, as well as for their return to the archive once the analysis has been completed. The delivery plan should consider the possibility of having shared proposals or sectons between different partcipants in the evaluaton process and that some of the Suppliers that were not selected request that their proposals be returned to them. PRINCIPLES OF CONTROL IN THE SUPPLY AREA Regardless of the concepts used in Procurement, there must always be efficient controls that must be properly applied to ensure that purchasing procedures are followed. MONITORING AND REVIEW Systematc and diligent purchasing management actvites help ensure compliance and ensure controls are understood. Awards, leters of recommendaton and supportng documenta- ton, whatever their amount may be reviewed by individuals or groups designated by Corpa. AUTHORIZATION Authorizaton refers to the responsibility to take actons, sign documents and approve transactons. The important purchasing functons are generally carried out by the procurement area of Corpa. PURCHASE PROCEDURE SCOPE The purchasing actvites of services required by Corpa are governed by the policies, practces and procedures established in this manual. PURCHASING PROCESS The purchase process begins when: • Corpa's Supply Area receives the specificatons duly approved by the Engineering area, which must contain all the technical guidelines for the acquisiton of the service. • The necessary funds required to cover the costs of goods and / or services must be properly budgeted, being Corpa's responsibility to ensure this. Corpa Engineering and Constructon Management Teams must:• Plan the requirements well in advance. www.Corpaing.net • Issue the purchase documents together with all the specificatons, special conditons, impressions and other documentaton to identfy the materials and / or services required. • Ensure that the costs of goods and / or services required have been properly budgeted and assigned. • Sufficiently and adequately justfy purchases of goods and / or services through the direct adjudicaton process and obtain the corresponding approvals according to the Process. The Corpa Procurement Team must: • Check that the technical specificaton sheets not only have the adequate descripton, but also that it is broad enough to allow the use of different alternatves. Whenever the material is specified by name or manufacturer, it will be assumed to be by material from that branch or its equivalent, unless the specificatons clearly indicate that no substtutes will be accepted. • Prepare the list of selected suppliers (Bidder List) to request quotes and review it in conjuncton with the Corpa Engineering area to be sent later. • Safeguard in an adequate file all the relevant documentaton necessary to ensure and demonstrate a transparent bidding process, documentng in electronic format the background and the different stages related to the purchase process, from the request for quotaton to the sending of the leter of recommendaton. . For example: sending the requests for quotaton (by fax or email), negotaton process, inquiries that have been made, comparatve tables, approvals, confirmaton of receipt of the purchase order by the supplier, etc. REQUEST FOR QUOTES In general, compettve processes will be followed in the purchase of goods or services except when: • There is an emergency that can cause significant delay or delays in services exceeding any savings that may have been achieved through a compettve process. In this case, the corresponding authorizaton must be requested. • When an unsafe situaton arises that consttutes an emergency and must be corrected immediately. • Only one source is capable of meetng technical and delivery requirements. • These are materials purchased direct www.Corpaing.net ly from their Original Manufacturer (OEM) or their authorized representat- ve. • It is justfied and advantageous for Corpa to negotate prices directly with an experienced supplier company, and to establish previously agreed terms through a compettve process. • Market conditons or the nature of the requirement indicate that a compettve process would not be beneficial to Corpa, for example: - When one or two suppliers dominate the market. - It is done through the purchase of new, unusual or high-tech goods, in which quality and technical characteristcs are important. The reasons for not purchasing goods or services through a compettve process must be properly documented. www.Corpaing.net PURCHASE MECHANISM The general procedure for the purchase of materials is a functon of the estmated total value of the goods and services specified in the specificatons. Depending on the estmated total value of the equipment or service, the actvity should be carried out as follows: Total Purchase Value US $ ’000 Purchase Mechanism = 5 >5 y = 35 >35 y =100 >100 Request for Quotaton by email or fax to at least one supplier. Once the quote is requested by email or fax, the supplier must formalize it by the aforementoned means (fax or email). Tender process by email or fax with at least two suppliers. Quotes must be in writng (fax or email). Tender process with at least three suppliers. Quotes must be in writng (fax or email). If there are only two suppliers, you must inform and request authorizaton from the Corpa supply manager to proceed. Tenders must be made through a closed envelope mechanism, and a commitee must open the proposals simultaneously. Another alternatve is to carry out tenders through a sotware (Tender Portal) where bidders will be given a username and password to upload their offers, which will then be opened simultaneously by the system. Tender process with at least three suppliers. If there are only two suppliers, you must inform and request authorizaton from the Corpa supply manager to proceed. www.Corpaing.net CONTENTS OF THE QUOTE REQUEST The writen request (fax or email) for quotes must include the following: a) Cover leter with a summary of Corpa requirements, clearly establishing the closing date and tme for receipt of offers. b) Specificatons (sheets, plans, documents) for each equipment or services, defining their characteristcs. c) Commercial conditons. d) Instructons indicatng rules and recommendatons that must be followed during the process. The request for quotatons must be writen (email or fax), or in a sealed envelope according to the value of the purchase in accordance with the detail in point 8.4 of this procedure and considering whether they are critcal and strategic items for the project. Offers in sealed envelopes will be received in the Supply Area and will only be opened ater the closing date and tme for receipt of offers. They can be opened before the closing date and tme only if quotes have been received from all invited providers. At least three Corpa Engineering employees must open the sealed envelopes. Employees partcipatng in the opening of envelopes should preferably be from the supply area or employees who are working directly with the project in queston. The main functon of the group that opens the offers will be: • Open offers. • Sign or initate the quotatons received (all the pages that make the financial proposal) • Identfy the original copy • Sign the Bid Opening form. • Sign the observatons made in the opening of envelopes, if any. Bids received ater the formal opening date will be returned unopened to the issuer, along with a leter explaining that the quote was invalidated as a result of late receipt. Exceptonally and when the other quotes have not yet been opened, a late quote may be accepted with the approval of the Supply Manager. All quotes will always be treated in a strictly confidental manner. Clarifica- ton requests related to commercial terms may be requested by email or fax. (Eg: payment terms less than 30 days, Advances, etc.). www.Corpaing.net EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS AND AWARD The Corpa purchasing officer will prepare the quotaton evaluaton to determine and recommend which is the best offer. This will be done by issuing a leter of recommendaton. Initally, the technical evaluaton will be the responsibility of Corpa Engineering, who will evaluate the proposals and then issue the Technical Analysis Report (TAR), which will include a technical ranking of the bidders with a brief descripton of the advantages and disadvantages of the offers of each of them. This technical evaluaton will then be sent to the client, who will carry out a new technical analysis and then prepare the final technical ranking. The final results of the technical evaluaton will be forwarded to the Procurement Team for final consolidaton. SELECTION CRITERIA The supplier chosen is the one that offers the most atractve combinaton of quality, price, delivery, performance, service and warranty. The main selecton criteria includes the evaluaton of factors such as: • Quality and technical conditons according to specificatons. • Price, including the possible impact of the exchange rate and possible costs of ackaging, transportaton, mobiliza- tons, customs expenses in the case of imported origin equipment, etc. The comparison of costs will be made taking into account all the costs involved up to the stage of use of the equipment and / or services. • Costs in case of terminaton of contracts or service order. • Environment when applicable, eg: Chemical Products • Other costs, if applicable, for example: price increase • Delivery schedule • Services post-sale • Guarantees and their impact on costs • Operatng costs When the general conditons are similar, the best price opton will be recommended; in case of equal prices, the company with the content with the highest Argentne partcipaton will be chosen according to the company's policy of optmizing regional and natonal resources. The award recommendaton leter (LOR) will be approved by the managers of Corpa Engineering and subsequently by the client according to the following authorizaton chain according www.Corpaing.net to the amounts to know: PM: Project Manager P: Purchasing Manager AM: Administration Manager FROM: Executive Director PARTIAL AWARDS The selecton of the best alternatve in a compettve process, based on a vertcal evaluaton of the proposals received, that is, making a comparison of the total value of each bidder consttutes a standard procedure. However, the buyer may recommend an award based on a horizontal evaluaton of a purchase from two or more suppliers, in those cases where a economic advantage of a value not less than US $ 1,000 (provided that the bidders have been informed of the possibility of a direct award or if the supplier accepts a partal award, although it has not been announced in advance). CLARIFICATION OF QUOTES The clarificaton of the proposals will be carried out when necessary as a consequence of the complexity of the specificatons for the constructon of the project, to understand its implica- tons and ensure that the bidders fully know the requirements of Corpa. Clarificatons are generally required for: • Ensure that users (Engineering / Client) understand the scope of the proposals submited and that bidders understand the scope of the applica- ton requirements. • Achieve full compatbility (technical and commercial) of the proposals with the Request for Quotaton. • Define the effects of significant changes to the original requirements that may have been introduced ater receipt of proposals. • Ensure that the bidders have documented all the relevant aspects and allow the correcton of the errors detected in the quotes. • Discuss the price of items that may not be in accordance with the requirements in the Request for Quotaton. The objectve of the clarificatons will be to ensure that the bidder has not been disqualified without having made the fair and reasonable consideratons to its proposals. During this process, the Purchasing Officer and the Supplier can exchange correspondence (leters, e-mails and faxes). Once all issues have been resolved, bidders will confirm any clarificaton or modificaton in writng. www.Corpaing.net The Purchasing Officer must document all actvites during the clarificaton process (including verbal communica- tons) and ensure an adequate file. The meetng minutes signed by the Supplier are considered adequate documentaton for the final selecton. During the Clarificaton stage, changes in the economic proposal will not be accepted; Any changes to the specifica- tons must be made ensuring that no advantage is given to any of the bidders. LEVELING OF QUOTES Leveling is an internal process that aims to adjust quoted prices to a common basis so that they can be compared. The purpose is to present each quote in its actual positon, before choosing the supplier to whom the order will be awarded. Only the following areas will be leveled: • Technical quality, for example, progress in its efficiency, reliability, operaton, etc. • Work Schedule / Delivery Times • Freight and Customs expenses, if applicable • Proposed organizaton and key personnel. • Payment schedules, cash flow, etc. • Other implicit issues, such as inventory levels. The Leveling process will be carried out once all the clarificatons have been carried out. REJECTION OF A QUOTE Whenever there may be reasons not to award a business, all writen offers will be rejected and the purchase will be canceled or restarted. Reasons for rejectng proposals can be, for example: • That the requirements of the Request for Quotaton are not complied with. • Inappropriate, unclear or poor specificatons. • Quotatons prepared not independently, but with mutual agreement between the bidders. The decision to reject proposals will be made in writng and will be approved by the Supply Manager. PRE-AWARD MEETING For the purchase of all critcal equipment or services involving large investments, a meetng will be scheduled with the selected bidder (s), prior to www.Corpaing.net the award and once approval has been obtained, if this is deemed necessary. The objectve of these meetngs will be to ensure the successful start of the service delivery or provision process. NEGOTIATION Provided it is appropriate and with the objectve of improving the conditons of the most economical proposal of the compettve process, additonal elements identfied during the evalua- ton process may be negotated. Some cases in which negotaton can be considered during the compettve process are: • Quoted prices exceed the budget and are higher than market estmates • Lack of a real compettve environment for being a monopoly market • Significant changes in the requirements since the quotatons were received • Savings opportunites. The negotaton will be the responsibility of a team made up of the Purchasing Officer, the Client, the Purchasing Manager and the person in charge of Engineering, the later in the event that the amount of the purchase justfies it; and this will be duly documented following the aforementoned procedures for meetngs with suppliers. PURCHASE ORDERS All Purchase Orders will be prepared and issued by the Corpa Supply Area. The Corpa Procurement Team will ensure that the provider's communicatons do not conflict with the Purchase Order. The Corpa Procurement Team will be responsible for clarifying any queries related to commercial issues in the Purchase Order, and will coordinate any technical clarificatons with the end user. CHANGES OF ORDER All modificatons to a Purchase Order require a Change of Order that has the prior approval of the Purchasing and Administraton Manager, if this affects your budget. If there is an impact on the price and conditons, the approval of the order change will take place according to what is mentoned in point 8.7 of this manual. In determining the approval level, the original value plus all subsequent changes will be taken into account. www.Corpaing.net PRICE ADJUSTMENTS Corpa’s Procurement Team must agree adjustment formulas for contracts and service orders in conjunc- ton with the awarded provider in order to update prices over tme, taking into account the inflatonary process in which Argentna is in, as well as also the updates of parity for each one of the unions that intervene in the services
